Overview This guide documents the health monitoring system implemented for the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP). The health monitoring system provides real-time metrics collection, health status reporting, and resilience mechanisms to ensure system reliability and observability.
Health Monitoring Components System Architecture The health monitoring system consists of the following components:
SystemMetricsCollector: Collects JVM and system-level metrics HealthCheckService: Provides health check endpoints and manages agent health status Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents cascading failures during outages Agent State Monitoring: Tracks agent state transitions for health assessment NATS Health Endpoints: For querying system and agent health status Metrics Collection The SystemMetricsCollector gathers various system and JVM metrics:</description></item></channel></rss>
