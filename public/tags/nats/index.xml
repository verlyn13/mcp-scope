Overview This guide details the recommended containerized development environment for the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) using Podman and Podman Compose. This setup provides environment consistency, isolation, and resource efficiency while maintaining development speed.
Why Podman? Podman is particularly well-suited for the MCP development on Fedora Linux for several key reasons:
Lower Resource Overhead: Podman is a daemonless container engine that consumes fewer resources than Docker&amp;rsquo;s daemon-based approach Native to Fedora: Podman comes pre-installed or easily available on Fedora, making it a natural fit Docker Compose Compatibility: Podman supports Docker Compose files through podman-compose Rootless Containers: Podman allows running containers without root privileges, improving security Systemd Integration: Better integration with Linux systemd for service management Prerequisites Before setting up the containerized environment, ensure you have the following installed:</description></item></channel></rss>
