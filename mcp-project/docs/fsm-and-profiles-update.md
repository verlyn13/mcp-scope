# MCP Framework Update: FSM Implementation and Roles

This document provides an overview of the recent updates to the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP), including the complete implementation of the Finite State Machine (FSM) framework, NATS integration, and the introduction of specialized roles and components.

## 1. FSM Framework Implementation

The Finite State Machine (FSM) framework has been fully implemented, providing robust state management for agents in the MCP system:

### Key Components

- **AgentState** - Enhanced with detailed error information and comprehensive state definitions
- **AgentEvent** - Expanded to include all required event types for agent lifecycle management
- **AgentStateMachine** - Implemented using Tinder's StateMachine library for reliable state transitions
- **BaseAgent** - Abstract implementation providing common agent functionality
- **SmolAgent** - Lightweight implementation for development and testing scenarios

### Features

- Full state lifecycle management
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Event-driven architecture
- Lightweight testing alternatives
- Comprehensive documentation

## 2. NATS Integration Enhancement

The NATS messaging infrastructure has been significantly enhanced:

- Typed message publishing and subscription
- Standardized topic structure
- Request-reply pattern support
- Improved connection management
- Comprehensive error handling

## 3. Orchestration Components

The orchestration layer has been implemented with these components:

- **Orchestrator** - Central coordination for agent management
- **TaskScheduler** - Priority-based scheduling with dependency support
- **AgentDiscovery** - Dynamic agent registration and discovery
- **HealthMonitor** - Agent health tracking and management

## 4. Specialized Components and Roles

### SmolAgent

A lightweight agent implementation designed for:

- Development and testing scenarios
- Resource-constrained environments
- Rapid prototyping
- Creating test doubles and mocks

SmolAgent provides the full McpAgent interface without the overhead of NATS integration or external dependencies.

Key features:
- Minimal resource requirements
- Lambda-based task handlers
- FSM integration
- Simple initialization

See the [SmolAgent Guide](smol-agent-guide.md) for detailed documentation.

### Documentation Architect

Role profile for the documentation management specialist:

- Content architecture design
- Documentation standards definition
- Content planning and prioritization
- Workflow design and governance

See the [Documentation Architect Guide](documentation-architect-guide.md) for details on responsibilities and deliverables.

### Build Engineer

Role profile for the technical implementation specialist:

- Core framework implementation
- Development environment setup
- Integration and testing
- Deployment and operations

See the [Build Engineer Profile](build-engineer-profile.md) for comprehensive information on this role.

## 5. Usage Examples

### SmolAgent Example

The repository now includes a complete example of using SmolAgent:

```kotlin
// Create a SmolAgent with custom task handler
val agent = SmolAgent.withHandler(
    handler = { task ->
        when (task.taskType) {
            "example.task" -> TaskResult(
                taskId = task.taskId,
                status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED,
                result = "Task processed successfully",
                executionTimeMs = 100
            )
            else -> TaskResult(
                taskId = task.taskId,
                status = TaskStatus.FAILED,
                errorMessage = "Unsupported task type",
                executionTimeMs = 50
            )
        }
    },
    agentId = "test-agent",
    capabilities = setOf(Capability.Custom("testing"))
)

// Initialize and use
agent.initialize()
val result = agent.processTask(task)
```

See the full example in `mcp-core/src/main/kotlin/com/example/mcp/examples/SmolAgentExample.kt`.

## 6. Next Steps

### For Developers

1. Review the updated [FSM Implementation Summary](fsm-implementation-summary.md)
2. Explore the SmolAgent for testing use cases
3. Use the BaseAgent for full-featured agent implementations
4. Refer to role documentation for clarity on responsibilities

### For the Project

1. Complete the camera agent implementation using the FSM framework
2. Implement health monitoring using the new infrastructure
3. Add comprehensive testing for all components
4. Begin documentation integration

## 7. Documentation Updates

New documentation has been added to support these components:

- [FSM Implementation Summary](fsm-implementation-summary.md)
- [SmolAgent Guide](smol-agent-guide.md)
- [Documentation Architect Guide](documentation-architect-guide.md)
- [Build Engineer Profile](build-engineer-profile.md)

## 8. Conclusion

With these implementations, the MCP project now has a solid foundation for agent-based development. The FSM framework provides robust state management, while the NATS integration enables efficient communication. The addition of SmolAgent offers flexibility for different development scenarios, and the role documentation clarifies responsibilities.

These components align with the project architecture and provide the necessary infrastructure for the next phases of development.
