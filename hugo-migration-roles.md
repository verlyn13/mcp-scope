# ScopeCam MCP Documentation: Hugo Migration Roles and Responsibilities

üü¢ **Active**

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Hugo Migration Index](/hugo-migration-index.md)

## Overview

This document defines the roles and responsibilities for implementing the Hugo documentation migration, specifically clarifying the division of responsibilities between the Documentation Architect and the Build Engineer. This collaboration model ensures that each specialist focuses on their area of expertise while working together toward a successful migration.

## Role Division

The migration to Hugo requires expertise in both documentation architecture and build engineering. The following role division leverages each specialist's strengths:

### Documentation Architect Responsibilities

The Documentation Architect is responsible for the content, structure, and information architecture:

1. **Migration Planning**
   - Creating the overall migration strategy
   - Mapping existing documentation to Hugo structure
   - Defining content organization and taxonomies
   - Setting standards for front matter and metadata

2. **Content Migration**
   - Creating content migration specifications
   - Reviewing migrated content for accuracy
   - Ensuring proper cross-referencing
   - Preserving status tracking and versioning

3. **Theme Requirements**
   - Defining theme requirements and specifications
   - Creating visual design concepts
   - Specifying shortcodes and components needed
   - Validating theme implementation against requirements

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Updating documentation guidelines for Hugo
   - Creating templates for new content
   - Defining status tracking implementation
   - Setting contribution standards

### Build Engineer Responsibilities

The Build Engineer is responsible for technical implementation and infrastructure:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Creating the Hugo container environment
   - Configuring the Hugo project structure
   - Setting up theme scaffolding
   - Implementing multi-environment configuration

2. **Build System Integration**
   - Integrating Hugo builds with existing CI/CD
   - Creating GitHub Actions workflows
   - Setting up automated validation
   - Configuring deployment processes

3. **Theme Implementation**
   - Implementing the theme based on specifications
   - Creating layout templates and partials
   - Developing custom shortcodes
   - Building responsive layouts

4. **Development Environment**
   - Integrating with podman-compose environment
   - Setting up hot reload for documentation
   - Implementing validation tools
   - Creating build scripts and helpers

## Collaboration Points

The Documentation Architect and Build Engineer will collaborate at these key points:

1. **Initial Planning**
   - Joint review of migration strategy
   - Agreement on technical approach
   - Definition of success criteria
   - Timeline alignment

2. **Content Structure**
   - Documentation Architect defines structure
   - Build Engineer implements in Hugo
   - Joint review of implementation
   - Iterative refinement

3. **Theme Development**
   - Documentation Architect provides requirements
   - Build Engineer creates implementation
   - Joint review of visual elements
   - Iterative feedback and refinement

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Documentation Architect defines quality criteria
   - Build Engineer implements automated tests
   - Joint review of validation results
   - Collaborative issue resolution

## Implementation Workflow

The migration will follow this collaborative workflow:

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Specification**
   - Documentation Architect creates migration plan and specifications
   - Build Engineer reviews for technical feasibility
   - Joint approval of final plan

2. **Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup**
   - Build Engineer creates Hugo environment
   - Documentation Architect validates content structure
   - Joint review of base setup

3. **Phase 3: Content Migration**
   - Build Engineer creates migration tools
   - Documentation Architect guides content conversion
   - Joint validation of migrated content

4. **Phase 4: Theme Implementation**
   - Build Engineer implements theme
   - Documentation Architect reviews against requirements
   - Joint refinement of visual elements

5. **Phase 5: Integration and Deployment**
   - Build Engineer implements CI/CD workflows
   - Documentation Architect validates deployment
   - Joint verification of final system

## Handoff Documents

To facilitate collaboration, these handoff documents will be created:

### From Documentation Architect to Build Engineer

1. **Content Structure Specification**
   - Detailed content organization
   - Section hierarchy
   - Taxonomy requirements

2. **Theme Requirements**
   - Visual design specifications
   - Component requirements
   - Shortcode functionality
   - Navigation requirements

3. **Content Validation Criteria**
   - Quality standards
   - Testing requirements
   - Success metrics

### From Build Engineer to Documentation Architect

1. **Technical Implementation Plan**
   - Container configuration
   - Build system design
   - Integration points

2. **Theme Implementation Guide**
   - Component usage
   - Custom shortcodes
   - Content creation workflows

3. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Build process
   - Validation steps
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Communication Channels

To ensure effective collaboration:

1. **Weekly Sync Meetings**
   - Review progress
   - Address blockers
   - Align on next steps

2. **Shared Documentation Repository**
   - Implementation specifications
   - Progress tracking
   - Issue documentation

3. **Pull Request Reviews**
   - Documentation Architect reviews content changes
   - Build Engineer reviews technical implementations
   - Joint sign-off on major milestones

## Next Steps

To begin implementation:

1. **Documentation Architect**
   - Finalize migration specifications (1 week)
   - Create content structure document (1 week)
   - Develop theme requirements (2 weeks)

2. **Build Engineer**
   - Review migration specifications (concurrent)
   - Create technical implementation plan (1 week)
   - Set up containerized environment (2 weeks)

3. **Joint Activities**
   - Kickoff meeting (immediate)
   - Review existing documentation structure (1 week)
   - Agree on technical approach (1 week)

## Conclusion

This role division leverages the strengths of both the Documentation Architect and Build Engineer to implement the Hugo migration efficiently. The Documentation Architect focuses on content, structure, and standards, while the Build Engineer handles infrastructure, automation, and technical implementation. Through clear communication and collaboration, these roles will work together to deliver a successful documentation migration.
