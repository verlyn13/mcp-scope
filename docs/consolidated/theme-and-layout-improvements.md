# MCP Theme and Layout Improvements

## Overview

This document addresses the improvements made to the MCP Hugo theme and build page layout that have not yet been fully incorporated into the deployed site. It outlines the changes made, the implementation status, and the steps required to build and validate the enhanced theme.

## Theme Improvement Status

The MCP theme has been enhanced with several significant improvements:

- **Dual-layer navigation**: A new navigation structure with primary and secondary navigation levels
- **Status indicators**: Visual indicators for document status (complete, draft, in-progress, review)
- **Progress tracking**: Visual representation of progress through multi-part guides
- **Responsive design**: Improved mobile and tablet display capabilities

These improvements are implemented in the `themes/mcp-theme/` directory but have not yet been built and deployed through GitHub Actions.

## Key Theme Components

The custom MCP theme includes:

```
themes/mcp-theme/
├── theme.toml                # Theme configuration
├── assets/                   # Theme assets
│   ├── css/                  # Stylesheets 
│   ├── js/                   # JavaScript
│   └── images/               # Theme-specific images
└── layouts/                  # Layout templates
    ├── _default/             # Default layouts
    ├── partials/             # Reusable template parts
    ├── shortcodes/           # Custom shortcode implementations
    └── index.html            # Home page template
```

## Build Page Improvements

The build page has been redesigned with:

1. **Enhanced Section Organization**
   - Clearer visual hierarchy
   - Improved section delineation
   - Better use of whitespace

2. **Navigation Enhancements**
   - Sticky navigation for lengthy documentation
   - "On this page" section links
   - Breadcrumb navigation for deep content

3. **Content Presentation**
   - Improved code block styling
   - Better table formatting
   - Enhanced image display options

## Building the Improved Theme

To build and verify the improved theme:

### 1. Local Build Verification

```bash
# Run a local Hugo server with the new theme
hugo serve

# Alternative for containerized environments
./mcp-docs serve
```

Check the following aspects:
- Correct application of dual-layer navigation
- Status indicator display
- Mobile responsiveness (test at various viewport sizes)
- Shortcode rendering

### 2. GitHub Actions Deployment

To deploy the improved theme:

1. Ensure all theme assets are committed to the repository
2. Push changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Monitor the Actions tab for build progress
4. Verify the deployed site at https://verlyn13.github.io/mcp-scope/

If you need to force a rebuild:

```bash
# Manual workflow trigger
gh workflow run "Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages" --ref main
```

## Theme Configuration Integration

The improved theme relies on proper configuration in:

1. **Hugo Configuration**
   ```toml
   # config/_default/config.toml
   theme = "mcp-theme"
   
   [params.theme]
   enableDualNavigation = true
   enableStatusIndicators = true
   enableProgressTracking = true
   ```

2. **Frontmatter Requirements**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Document Title"
   weight: 10
   status: "complete" # Options: complete, draft, in-progress, review
   progress: 75 # Optional percentage for progress tracking
   ---
   ```

## Theme Testing Checklist

Before deploying the new theme site-wide, verify:

- [ ] Home page layout renders correctly
- [ ] Navigation works on all device sizes
- [ ] Shortcodes display properly
- [ ] Status indicators show the correct states
- [ ] Progress tracking displays accurately
- [ ] Print stylesheet functions correctly
- [ ] Dark mode works (if implemented)
- [ ] Page load performance is acceptable

## Known Issues and Roadmap

### Current Limitations

1. **IE11 Support**: Limited compatibility with Internet Explorer
2. **Print Layout**: Some complex layouts may not print optimally
3. **Animation Performance**: Some animations may be resource-intensive on older devices

### Planned Improvements

1. **Theme Customization Options**
   - Color scheme selection
   - Font size adjustment
   - Layout density options

2. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Improved screen reader support
   - Keyboard navigation optimizations
   - Focus state visibility improvements

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Asset minification
   - Lazy loading for images
   - Reduced JavaScript reliance

## Theme Deployment Process Integration

For GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/hugo-deploy.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... existing steps
      
      - name: Process theme assets
        run: |
          # Add any preprocessing steps for theme assets here
          # Examples: SCSS compilation, JavaScript bundling
          cd themes/mcp-theme/assets
          # Commands for asset processing
      
      - name: Build with Hugo
        run: |
          hugo \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
```

## Conclusion

The MCP theme improvements represent a significant upgrade to the documentation presentation and user experience. While the changes are implemented in the theme directory, they require a complete build and deployment to be visible on the live site.

By following the build and verification steps outlined in this document, you can ensure that the improved theme is properly deployed and functioning correctly.
