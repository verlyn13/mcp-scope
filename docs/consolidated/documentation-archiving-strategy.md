# MCP Documentation and Implementation Archiving Strategy

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/README.md)

## üü¢ **Active**

This document outlines the strategy for archiving completed implementation components and documentation in the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) project. It establishes a clear process for managing the documentation lifecycle, maintaining version history, and ensuring traceability between active and archived documentation.

## Purpose

The archiving strategy serves several critical purposes:

1. **Clarity**: Distinguish between active (in-progress) and completed (stable) components
2. **Traceability**: Maintain a clear history of implementation decisions and progress
3. **Organization**: Prevent documentation sprawl and keep the active working set focused
4. **Consistency**: Ensure uniform handling of completed work across the project
5. **Completeness**: Verify all necessary documentation exists before archiving

## Completion Criteria

Before a component or documentation can be considered complete and ready for archiving, it must meet the following criteria:

### Implementation Completion Criteria

1. All planned features implemented according to architecture specifications
2. Unit test coverage meets or exceeds 80%
3. Integration tests pass successfully
4. No known high-severity bugs or issues
5. Code review completed with all feedback addressed
6. Performance metrics meet defined targets

### Documentation Completion Criteria

1. All required sections fully completed (no TODOs or placeholders)
2. Technical accuracy verified by subject matter expert
3. Internal references and links validated
4. Screenshots and diagrams up to date
5. Version history complete and accurate
6. Related documentation cross-references established

## Archiving Process

### For Implementation Components

1. **Final Verification**
   - Conduct final review against completion criteria
   - Resolve any outstanding issues
   - Run final integration tests

2. **Status Update**
   - Update component status to "Stable" in tracking system
   - Add completion date to version history
   - Update implementation status document

3. **Snapshot Creation**
   - Create a Git tag for the stable version
   - Document the tag in the changelog
   - Update version numbers in relevant files

4. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Conduct handover meeting if applicable
   - Document any special considerations for maintenance

### For Documentation

1. **Status Update**
   - Change document status from "Active" to "Stable"
   - Update the last_updated field
   - Add completion note to frontmatter

2. **Archiving**
   - Move from `/docs/[category]/` to `/docs/archived/[category]/`
   - Maintain the same filename to preserve links
   - Add redirect from old location if applicable

3. **Index Updates**
   - Update documentation index to reflect new status and location
   - Add to "Stable Documentation" section in README

4. **Notification**
   - Announce archiving in project communication channels
   - Update status in weekly implementation report

## Version Control and History

### Version Numbering

Documentation and implementation components use semantic versioning:

- **Major version (1.x.x)**: Significant changes that may require updates to other components
- **Minor version (x.1.x)**: Feature additions or substantial content updates
- **Patch version (x.x.1)**: Minor corrections, clarifications, or formatting changes

### Changelog Maintenance

Each archived document must maintain a changelog with the following information:

```
## Changelog

- 1.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Initial stable version
  - Complete implementation of [feature]
  - Verified integration with [component]

- 0.2.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Beta implementation
  - Added [feature]
  - Fixed [issue]

- 0.1.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Initial draft
  - Basic structure and concepts
```

## Maintaining Traceability

To maintain traceability between active and archived documentation:

1. **References and Links**
   - All references to archived documentation should include version number
   - Include "Superseded by" links in archived documentation
   - Include "Previous versions" links in active documentation

2. **Document Relationships**
   - Maintain `related_docs` metadata even in archived documents
   - Add archive status to document frontmatter
   - Create versioned document maps for major releases

## Archiving Timeline

Documents and implementation components should be reviewed for potential archiving:

1. At the completion of each implementation phase
2. When a component reaches stable status
3. During quarterly documentation reviews
4. When superseded by a newer version

## Special Considerations

### Living Documents

Some documents are considered "living documents" that are continuously updated rather than archived. These include:

- Project README files
- Consolidated status documents
- Issue registries
- Onboarding guides

These documents should be clearly marked as "Living Document" in their frontmatter.

### Temporary Documentation

Temporary documentation (like sprint-specific plans) should be:

1. Clearly marked as temporary in frontmatter
2. Given an expiration date
3. Automatically archived after expiration
4. Excluded from primary documentation indexes

## Implementation in Documentation System

### Directory Structure

```
/docs/
  /archived/              # Root for all archived documentation
    /architecture/        # Archived architecture documents
    /implementation/      # Archived implementation guides
    /project/             # Archived project documents
  /architecture/          # Active architecture documents
  /implementation/        # Active implementation guides
  /project/               # Active project documents
  /consolidated/          # Major consolidated documents
```

### Frontmatter Extensions

Add the following to document frontmatter to support archiving:

```yaml
archiving:
  archived_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"     # Date document was archived
  archive_reason: "Superseded"    # Reason for archiving
  superseded_by: "/docs/path"     # Document that replaces this one
  stable_version: "1.0.0"         # Version when deemed stable
```

## Maintenance Responsibilities

The following roles have specific responsibilities in the archiving process:

1. **Documentation Architect**: Oversees the overall archiving strategy and ensures consistency
2. **Technical Lead**: Verifies technical accuracy before archiving
3. **Project Manager**: Approves component completion status
4. **Build Engineer**: Manages implementation component archiving and versioning

## Archiving Checklist

Before archiving any documentation or implementation component, verify:

- [ ] All completion criteria met
- [ ] Version information updated
- [ ] Changelog complete and accurate
- [ ] Related documents updated with references
- [ ] Indexes and navigation updated
- [ ] Redirects implemented if needed
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
