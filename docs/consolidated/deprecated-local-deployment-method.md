# Deprecated Local Deployment Method for Hugo Documentation

âš« **ARCHIVED** - This document preserves information about a deployment approach that is no longer in use.

## Context and Status

This document archives the previous local script-based approach to deploying the MCP documentation site to GitHub Pages. This method has been **fully replaced** by GitHub Actions automation as of March 2025.

For the current official deployment method, please refer to:
- [GitHub Pages Deployment Solution](/content/project/github-pages-deployment-solution.md)
- [GitHub Actions Deployment Guide](/content/project/github-actions-deployment-guide.md)

## Historical Implementation

The project previously used a set of shell scripts for manual deployment:

1. `deploy-docs.sh` - Built the Hugo site
2. `deploy-gh-pages.sh` - Attempted manual deployment with branch switching
3. `deploy-to-github-pages.sh` - Used a local GitHub token to authenticate and deploy

### Prerequisites (Historical)

This approach required:
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with specific permissions
- Token stored in a local secrets file
- Manual branch management and switching
- Local Hugo installation

### Process Overview (Historical)

The previous deployment workflow involved:
1. Building the site locally
2. Manually switching to the gh-pages branch
3. Copying built files to the correct location
4. Committing and pushing with personal access token
5. Switching back to the main branch

## Issues That Led to Replacement

This approach was ultimately replaced because:

1. **Branch Switching Problems**: Developers would often get "stuck" in the gh-pages branch
2. **Path Resolution Issues**: Scripts couldn't reliably locate directories after branch switching
3. **Security Concerns**: Required managing personal access tokens locally
4. **Inconsistent Environment**: Results varied depending on local environment differences
5. **Manual Process**: Required manual intervention and could not be scheduled or triggered by events

## Transition to GitHub Actions

In March 2025, the project migrated to GitHub Actions for deployment, as documented in:
- [GITHUB-PAGES-DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md](/GITHUB-PAGES-DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md)
- [GitHub Actions Deployment Guide](/content/project/github-actions-deployment-guide.md)

The GitHub Actions approach resolved all the issues with the prior method by:
- Eliminating branch switching
- Using a consistent build environment
- Leveraging GitHub's built-in authentication
- Automating the entire process
- Providing clear logs and status updates

## Historical Scripts Reference

The original scripts remain in the repository root for historical reference only:
- `deploy-docs.sh`
- `deploy-gh-pages.sh`
- `deploy-to-github-pages.sh`

These scripts should not be used for current deployments.
