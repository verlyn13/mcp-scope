# MCP Agentic Roles Implementation Plan

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/README.md) | [‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Implementation Management Framework](/docs/consolidated/implementation-management-index.md)

## üü¢ **Active**

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for establishing the Documentation Architect and Build Engineer as agentic roles with role-switching capabilities within the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP). It defines the technical approach, implementation priorities, and best practices for memory management to ensure optimal performance and collaboration between these roles.

## 1. Agentic Roles Overview

The MCP project will implement two primary agentic roles that work in concert to maintain the project's implementation and documentation:

1. **Documentation Architect**: Responsible for maintaining the documentation system, ensuring alignment with implementation priorities, and managing the documentation lifecycle.

2. **Build Engineer**: Expert-level software engineer specializing in implementing state-of-the-art documentation systems with agentic capabilities and developing the core MCP server.

These roles will be implemented as a single agent with role-switching capabilities, allowing seamless transitions between roles based on current project needs.

## 3. Role-Switching Mechanism

### 3.1 Technical Implementation

The role-switching mechanism will be implemented using a context-aware agent framework that:

1. **Maintains Shared Memory**: Essential context is preserved across role transitions
2. **Implements Context Detection**: Automatically identifies the appropriate role based on task nature
3. **Provides Role-Specific Access**: Each role has access to appropriate tools and resources
4. **Ensures Seamless Transitions**: Knowledge is preserved during role switches
5. **Optimizes Memory Usage**: Efficiently manages memory during extended operations

### 3.2 Role Transition Rules

Role transitions will follow these rules:

1. **Documentation Tasks ‚Üí Documentation Architect**:
   - Documentation creation, review, or updates
