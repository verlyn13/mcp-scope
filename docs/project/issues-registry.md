# Issues Registry

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/README.md)

## Overview

The Issues Registry is a central catalog of known issues, limitations, pitfalls, and technical challenges in the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP). This document helps developers avoid common problems and provides solutions or workarounds where available.

## Using This Registry

- Issues are categorized by component or system area
- Each issue has a unique identifier (e.g., MCP-ARCH-001)
- Status indicators show if issues are open, being addressed, or resolved
- Cross-references link to technical documentation with more details

## Status Indicators

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| üî¥ **Open** | Known issue without a complete solution |
| üü† **In Progress** | Issue being actively addressed |
| üü° **Mitigated** | Partial solution or workaround available |
| üü¢ **Resolved** | Issue has been completely resolved |
| ‚ö´ **Won't Fix** | Issue acknowledged but won't be addressed |

## Core Architecture Issues

### MCP-ARCH-001: FSM Complexity with Many Agents

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Core Orchestrator  
**Description**: The state machine complexity increases non-linearly with the number of agents, potentially leading to performance issues with many agents.

**Impact**:
- System performance degradation with large numbers of agents
- Increased memory usage for state tracking
- More complex debugging of state transitions

**Mitigation**:
- Limit concurrent active agents to the available CPU cores
- Implement hierarchical state management
- Use efficient state representation
- See [Orchestrator Design](/docs/architecture/orchestrator-nats-integration.md) for implementation details

### MCP-ARCH-002: NATS Client Reconnection Logic

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: NATS Messaging Integration  
**Description**: Network disruptions can cause temporary loss of NATS connectivity, requiring robust reconnection handling.

**Impact**:
- Potential message loss during disconnection periods
- Agents may miss task assignments or updates
- System health reporting gaps

**Mitigation**:
- Implement exponential backoff reconnection strategy
- Buffer critical messages during disconnection
- Maintain sequence numbers for message ordering
- See [NATS Integration Resilience](/docs/architecture/orchestrator-nats-integration.md) for implementation details

## Camera Integration Issues

### MCP-CAM-001: USB Device Permission Handling

**Status**: üî¥ **Open**  
**Component**: Camera Integration Agent  
**Description**: Different operating systems handle USB device permissions differently, requiring platform-specific code.

**Impact**:
- Inconsistent device access across platforms
- Potential permission errors in production
- Complex error handling

**Current Status**:
- Linux implementation requires udev rules
- Windows implementation requires driver installation
- Cross-platform solution under investigation

### MCP-CAM-002: UVC Protocol Version Compatibility

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Camera Integration Agent  
**Description**: Different UVC protocol versions support different features, requiring careful capability detection.

**Impact**:
- Cameras may report capabilities they don't fully support
- Feature availability varies between devices
- Complex feature negotiation code

**Mitigation**:
- Implement progressive feature discovery
- Create device capability database
- Gracefully handle feature absence
- See [Camera Integration Agent](/docs/architecture/camera-integration-agent.md) for details

## Task Scheduling Issues

### MCP-SCHED-001: Task Priority Inversion

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Task Scheduler  
**Description**: Low-priority tasks can block high-priority tasks if resource dependencies are not carefully managed.

**Impact**:
- Critical tasks may be delayed
- Potential deadlocks in worst-case scenarios
- Unpredictable system performance

**Mitigation**:
- Implement priority inheritance
- Use deadline-based scheduling for critical tasks
- Monitor task execution times
- See [Task Scheduler Design](/docs/architecture/orchestrator-nats-integration.md) for details

### MCP-SCHED-002: Long-Running Task Management

**Status**: üü† **In Progress**  
**Component**: Task Scheduler  
**Description**: Long-running tasks can block agent resources and appear to be stalled.

**Impact**:
- System appears unresponsive during lengthy operations
- Health monitoring may incorrectly flag active agents as failed
- Resource underutilization

**Current Status**:
- Progress reporting API in development
- Task cancellation mechanism being designed
- Timeout handling improvements planned

## Health Monitoring Issues

### MCP-HEALTH-001: False Positive Detection

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Health Monitoring Framework  
**Description**: Transient issues can trigger false positive health alerts, especially under high system load.

**Impact**:
- Unnecessary agent restarts
- Alert fatigue for operators
- Wasted system resources

**Mitigation**:
- Implement adaptive thresholds based on system load
- Require multiple consecutive failures before alerting
- Use trend analysis instead of point-in-time checks
- See [Health Monitoring Framework](/docs/architecture/health-monitoring-framework.md) for details

### MCP-HEALTH-002: Resource Overhead

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Health Monitoring Framework  
**Description**: Health monitoring itself consumes system resources, which can impact performance if not carefully managed.

**Impact**:
- Additional CPU/memory usage for monitoring
- Network bandwidth for health check messages
- Potential performance impact under heavy load

**Mitigation**:
- Adaptive monitoring frequency based on system state
- Efficient metric collection methods
- Configurable monitoring detail level
- See [Health Monitoring Framework](/docs/architecture/health-monitoring-framework.md) for optimization details

## Development Environment Issues

### MCP-DEV-001: Environment Setup Complexity

**Status**: üü† **In Progress**  
**Component**: Development Tools  
**Description**: Setting up the development environment requires multiple dependencies and configuration steps.

**Impact**:
- Onboarding time for new developers
- Inconsistent environments between developers
- Complex troubleshooting of environment issues

**Current Status**:
- Containerized development environment in progress
- Automated setup script being developed
- Dependency management improvements planned

## Documentation Issues

### MCP-DOC-001: Interface Versioning Documentation

**Status**: üü† **In Progress**  
**Component**: Documentation System  
**Description**: Interface changes between versions need better documentation and tracking.

**Impact**:
- Potential compatibility issues during upgrades
- Developer confusion about API versioning
- Migration challenges

**Current Status**:
- Interface versioning strategy being developed
- API change documentation template in progress
- Version compatibility matrix planned

## Adding New Issues

When adding new issues to this registry:

1. Create a unique identifier with component prefix
2. Clearly describe the issue and its impact
3. Document any known workarounds or mitigations
4. Cross-reference relevant technical documentation
5. Assign appropriate status
6. Update the "last_updated" field in the front matter

## Issue Resolution Process

1. Issues are initially documented with Open status
2. Workarounds are added as they become available
3. Status is updated to In Progress when actively being addressed
4. Mitigated status is used when partial solutions exist
5. Resolved issues remain in the registry with solution documentation
6. Critical issues should trigger notification to the development team

## Periodic Review

This registry undergoes regular review to:

1. Update issue statuses
2. Add newly discovered issues
3. Verify resolution effectiveness
4. Archive obsolete issues
5. Identify patterns requiring architectural changes

## Cross-Referencing

When referencing issues from technical documentation, use the following format:

```markdown
This functionality has a [known issue with permission handling](/docs/project/issues-registry.md#mcp-cam-001-usb-device-permission-handling).
```

Similarly, issue descriptions should link to relevant technical documentation for more details.
