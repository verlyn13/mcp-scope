# Build Engineer Quick Start

## Getting Started with MCP Implementation

Welcome to the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) project! This quick start guide will get you up and running quickly.

### First Steps (Do This Now)

1. **Set up the containerized environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Podman and Podman Compose
   sudo dnf install -y podman podman-compose
   
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/example/mcp-project.git
   cd mcp-project
   
   # Create the containerization configuration (copy from guide)
   # See: /docs/guides/containerized-dev-environment.md
   
   # Start the environment
   podman-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Implement the core components** in this order:
   - Core agent interfaces and data models
   - NATS connection management
   - Agent state machine
   - Basic orchestrator

3. **Execute the initial test** to verify your implementation:
   ```bash
   # Inside the mcp-core container
   ./gradlew test
   ```

### Key Documentation

- [Containerized Development Environment](/docs/guides/containerized-dev-environment.md) - Complete setup guide
- [Build Engineer Onboarding Checklist](/docs/guides/build-engineer-onboarding-checklist.md) - Step-by-step task list
- [Implementation Guide](/docs/guides/build-engineer-implementation-guide.md) - Detailed implementation instructions

### Implementation Priorities

1. Environment setup with Podman
2. Core agent framework 
3. NATS messaging integration
4. Orchestrator with basic functionality
5. Camera integration agent with mock USB detection

Start with the containerized setup, then follow the onboarding checklist. When you encounter implementation questions, refer to the detailed implementation guide and technical specifications.
