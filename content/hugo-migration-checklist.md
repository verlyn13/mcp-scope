# Hugo Migration Content Checklist

ðŸŸ¢ **Active**

## Overview

This checklist provides a step-by-step guide for migrating existing documentation to the Hugo static site framework. It ensures consistent application of standards and proper conversion of content during the migration process.

## Pre-Migration Preparation

### Document Inventory

- [ ] Review the [Hugo Migration File Mapping](hugo-migration-file-mapping.md) document
- [ ] Identify all documents to be migrated in the current documentation
- [ ] Verify the mapping for each document to its new location in the Hugo structure
- [ ] Create a prioritized list of documents to migrate
- [ ] Document any dependencies between documents (cross-references)

### Environment Setup

- [ ] Ensure the Hugo environment is properly set up according to [Hugo Implementation Steps](hugo-implementation-steps-update.md)
- [ ] Verify that the containerized environment is working as expected
- [ ] Test the Hugo server with existing sample content
- [ ] Ensure you have appropriate editor with Markdown preview capability

## Content Migration Process

### Step 1: Section Structure Setup

- [ ] Create section index files (`_index.md`) for all required sections
- [ ] Ensure each section index includes appropriate front matter
- [ ] Verify section hierarchy is correctly represented in the content directory
- [ ] Test navigation between sections

### Step 2: Document Migration 

For each document:

#### Front Matter Conversion

- [ ] Copy the original document's front matter
- [ ] Update the `last_updated` date to the current date
- [ ] Convert `related_docs` paths to Hugo-compatible paths
- [ ] Verify and update tags as needed
- [ ] Ensure status is correctly specified
- [ ] Add Hugo-specific front matter if needed (weight, layout, etc.)

#### Content Conversion

- [ ] Copy the main content from the original document
- [ ] Update the status indicator at the top of the document
- [ ] Update navigation links to use Hugo paths
- [ ] Convert internal document links to Hugo format
- [ ] Update cross-layer references with appropriate notation
- [ ] Verify all tables are correctly formatted
- [ ] Ensure code blocks have appropriate language tags
- [ ] Check for any HTML that may need to be escaped or modified

#### Special Elements

- [ ] Convert progress bars to use the progress shortcode
- [ ] Convert status indicators to use the status shortcode
- [ ] Update related documents sections to use the related-docs shortcode
- [ ] Ensure figures and images have appropriate paths
- [ ] Verify that admonitions (notes, warnings) are correctly formatted

### Step 3: Migration Verification

For each migrated document:

- [ ] Render the document using the Hugo server
- [ ] Verify the document appears correctly in the navigation
- [ ] Check that status indicators display properly
- [ ] Verify all internal links work correctly
- [ ] Test cross-references to other documents
- [ ] Ensure all shortcodes render as expected
- [ ] Verify tables render correctly
- [ ] Check code block syntax highlighting
- [ ] Test responsive layout on different screen sizes

## Post-Migration Tasks

### Content Validation

- [ ] Run automated validation on front matter
- [ ] Check for broken links
- [ ] Verify all required documents have been migrated
- [ ] Ensure section indices list all contained documents
- [ ] Validate HTML output against web standards

### Section Indices Updates

- [ ] Update each section index with links to all contained documents
- [ ] Verify the organization and grouping of documents
- [ ] Add descriptive text for each section
- [ ] Ensure status indicators are consistently applied

### Navigation Refinement

- [ ] Review the navigation menu structure
- [ ] Adjust menu weights for logical ordering
- [ ] Verify breadcrumbs show correct hierarchy
- [ ] Test layer switching between Root and MCP documentation

## Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Run a final build of the site
- [ ] Verify all pages build without errors
- [ ] Check generated HTML for issues
- [ ] Test the site in multiple browsers
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works as expected
- [ ] Verify search functionality if implemented

## GitHub Pages Deployment

- [ ] Push the changes to the repository
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Check the deployed site on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Test navigation and links on the live site
- [ ] Verify any custom domain settings

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Create a tracking issue for any migration problems identified
- [ ] Document any content that couldn't be migrated correctly
- [ ] Gather feedback from team members on the new site
- [ ] Plan for any necessary improvements

## Maintenance Procedures

- [ ] Document the process for updating existing content
- [ ] Create guidelines for adding new content
- [ ] Set up regular validation checks
- [ ] Plan for ongoing improvements to the Hugo site

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Front Matter Issues

- **Problem**: Hugo doesn't recognize front matter
  - **Solution**: Ensure three dashes at start and end of front matter, check for invalid characters

### Link Issues

- **Problem**: Internal links return 404
  - **Solution**: Check if links use Hugo's path format, ensure target files exist

### Shortcode Issues

- **Problem**: Shortcodes don't render
  - **Solution**: Verify shortcode syntax, check if required parameters are provided

### Build Issues

- **Problem**: Hugo build fails
  - **Solution**: Check error message, look for syntax issues in templates or content
