# Documentation Standards

{{< status >}}

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/)

## Overview

The Standards section contains the documentation guidelines, templates, and best practices for the ScopeCam MCP documentation. These standards ensure consistency and quality across all documentation.

## Key Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [Documentation Guidelines](/standards/documentation-guidelines/) | Comprehensive guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation | üü¢ Active |

## Purpose of Standards

Documentation standards serve several key purposes:

1. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain a uniform style and structure across all documentation
2. **Improve Quality**: Set a high bar for documentation quality
3. **Facilitate Maintenance**: Make it easier to update and maintain documentation
4. **Support Collaboration**: Enable multiple contributors to work effectively
5. **Enhance Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is accessible to all users

## Using These Standards

When creating or updating documentation:

1. Start by reviewing the [Documentation Guidelines](/standards/documentation-guidelines/)
2. Apply the appropriate templates from the Templates section
3. Follow the status lifecycle for your document
4. Include all required metadata in front matter
5. Use the correct formatting for links, code samples, and diagrams

## Standards Compliance

All documentation in the ScopeCam MCP project should comply with these standards. The documentation review process includes verification of standards compliance.

If you encounter documentation that doesn't meet these standards:

1. Flag it in the Issues Registry
2. Update it if you are able to do so
3. Suggest specific improvements
