## Guide Types

Our implementation guides are organized into several categories:

### Onboarding Guides

Designed for new team members to get up to speed quickly:

- [Build Engineer Quick Start](/guides/build-engineer-quick-start/)
- [Build Engineer Onboarding Checklist](/guides/build-engineer-onboarding-checklist/)

### Implementation Guides

Step-by-step instructions for implementing specific components:

- [Build Engineer Implementation Guide](/guides/build-engineer-implementation-guide/)
- [Health Monitoring Guide](/guides/health-monitoring-guide/)

### Environment Setup

Guides for setting up and using development environments:

- [Containerized Development Environment](/guides/containerized-dev-environment/)

### Quality Assurance

Guides related to testing and quality assurance:

- [Testing Guide](/guides/testing-guide/)

## Using the Guides

Implementation guides are designed to be:

1. **Task-Oriented**: Focused on specific implementation tasks
2. **Step-by-Step**: Providing clear, sequential instructions
3. **Practical**: Including concrete examples and code snippets
4. **Comprehensive**: Covering prerequisites, implementation, and troubleshooting

When following a guide, make sure to:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure you have all required tools and components
2. **Follow in Sequence**: Steps are designed to be followed in order
3. **Verify Progress**: Use checkpoints to verify your progress
4. **Report Issues**: If you encounter issues, document them in the [Issues Registry](/project/issues-registry/)
