# Build Engineer Quick Start

{{< status >}}

## Getting Started with MCP Implementation

Welcome to the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) project! This quick start guide will get you up and running quickly.

### First Steps (Do This Now)

1. **Set up the containerized environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Podman and Podman Compose
   sudo dnf install -y podman podman-compose
   
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/example/mcp-project.git
   cd mcp-project
   
   # Create the containerization configuration (copy from guide)
   # See: /guides/containerized-dev-environment/
   
   # Start the environment
   podman-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Implement the core components** in this order:
   - Core agent interfaces and data models
   - NATS connection management
   - Agent state machine
   - Basic orchestrator

3. **Execute the initial test** to verify your implementation:
   ```bash
   # Inside the mcp-core container
   ./gradlew test
   ```

### Key Documentation

- [Containerized Development Environment](/guides/containerized-dev-environment/) - Complete setup guide
- [Build Engineer Onboarding Checklist](/guides/build-engineer-onboarding-checklist/) - Step-by-step task list
- [Implementation Guide](/guides/build-engineer-implementation-guide/) - Detailed implementation instructions

### Implementation Priorities

1. Environment setup with Podman
2. Core agent framework 
3. NATS messaging integration
4. Orchestrator with basic functionality
5. Camera integration agent with mock USB detection

### Implementation Progress

| Component | Status | Priority | Progress |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Environment Setup | 游릭 Active | High | {{< progress value="90" >}} |
| Core Agent Framework | 游릭 Active | High | {{< progress value="85" >}} |
| NATS Integration | 游리 Draft | High | {{< progress value="70" >}} |
| Orchestrator | 游리 Draft | Medium | {{< progress value="50" >}} |
| Camera Agent | 游리 Draft | Medium | {{< progress value="30" >}} |

### Time Estimates

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Initial setup | 30 minutes |
| Core implementation | 2-3 hours |
| First agent | 1-2 hours |
| Basic testing | 1 hour |

Start with the containerized setup, then follow the onboarding checklist. When you encounter implementation questions, refer to the detailed implementation guide and technical specifications.

## Next Steps

After completing the quick start setup:

1. Review the [Implementation Roadmap](/architecture/implementation-roadmap/)
2. Complete the [Onboarding Checklist](/guides/build-engineer-onboarding-checklist/)
3. Implement your first specialized agent
4. Set up the health monitoring framework
