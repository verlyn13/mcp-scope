# START HERE: Multi-Agent Control Platform Documentation

## Welcome to the MCP Documentation System

This document is the **mandatory first stop** for all team members working on the Multi-Agent Control Platform. It will direct you to the information you need based on your role and the current project focus.

## Current Project Focus

> 🔍 **CURRENT FOCUS**: Phase 1 Implementation - Core Infrastructure
>
> We are currently focused on implementing the core infrastructure components of the MCP platform, including the FSM framework, agent interfaces, NATS messaging integration, and basic health monitoring.

For detailed information on the current focus area, see the [Current Focus](/docs/project/current-focus.md) document, which is updated weekly.
