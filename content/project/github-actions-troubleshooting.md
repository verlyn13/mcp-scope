# Troubleshooting GitHub Actions Deployment

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter when deploying your Hugo site using GitHub Actions. Use this guide when your deployment is failing or not working as expected.

## Workflow Not Running

**Issue:** Changes are pushed to the main branch, but no workflow is triggered.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Workflow Trigger Configuration**
   - Verify the workflow file has the correct branch trigger:
     ```yaml
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     ```
   - If your default branch is not "main", update this to match your default branch

2. **Inspect Repository Permissions**
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure that actions are allowed to run on the repository
   - Verify that the workflow has appropriate permissions to run

3. **Look for Workflow Errors**
   - Check the Actions tab for any failed workflow initializations
   - Look at the repository's Actions logs for error messages

## Build Failures

**Issue:** The workflow runs but fails during the build step.

**Solutions:**

1. **Hugo Version Mismatch**
   - If you see errors about modules, functions, or templates not being available:
     - Check the Hugo version in the workflow file
     - Match it to the version you're using for local development
     - Update the HUGO_VERSION value in the workflow file if needed

2. **Theme Missing**
   - If you see errors about a missing theme:
     - Ensure the theme is included in your repository or correctly added as a submodule
     - Verify the workflow is checking out submodules:
       ```yaml
       - name: Checkout repository
         uses: actions/checkout@v3
         with:
           submodules: recursive
           fetch-depth: 0
       ```

3. **Module/Dependencies Issues**
   - For Hugo module errors:
     - Check that your go.mod and go.sum files are committed
     - Ensure any external dependencies are accessible
     - Consider vendoring your dependencies by running `hugo mod vendor` locally and committing the vendor directory

4. **Content Errors**
   - For errors in specific content files:
     - Check for unclosed shortcodes
     - Look for incorrect front matter formatting
     - Verify file encoding (should be UTF-8)

## Deployment Failures

**Issue:** The build succeeds, but deployment fails.

**Solutions:**

1. **GitHub Pages Not Enabled**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for the repository
   - Verify the source is set to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Check the workflow has the correct permissions:
     ```yaml
     permissions:
       contents: read
       pages: write
       id-token: write
     ```

3. **GitHub API Rate Limiting**
   - If you see rate limit errors:
     - Reduce the frequency of deployments
     - Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually one hour)

4. **Artifact Upload Issues**
   - If the build succeeds but the artifact upload fails:
     - Check for large files that might exceed GitHub's limits
     - Ensure the path to the public directory is correct
     - Verify the public directory contains the expected files

## Site Deployed But Not Accessible

**Issue:** The workflow completes successfully, but the site returns 404 errors or doesn't look right.

**Solutions:**

1. **Incorrect Base URL**
   - Check your Hugo configuration file (config.toml or config.yaml)
   - Ensure baseURL matches your GitHub Pages URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`
   - Verify the workflow is setting the correct base URL:
     ```yaml
     - name: Build with Hugo
       run: |
         hugo \
           --minify \
           --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
     ```

2. **Missing .nojekyll File**
   - Ensure the workflow creates a .nojekyll file:
     ```yaml
     - name: Create .nojekyll file
       run: touch public/.nojekyll
     ```
   - This prevents GitHub from processing the site with Jekyll

3. **Path Issues for Assets**
   - If images or CSS files aren't loading:
     - Check for absolute URLs that might be incorrect
     - Verify asset paths are relative or use the baseURL
     - Inspect the deployed files to confirm assets were uploaded correctly

4. **Custom Domain Issues**
   - If using a custom domain:
     - Verify the CNAME file is being created and deployed
     - Check DNS settings are correct
     - Ensure HTTPS is properly configured

## Site Content Problems

**Issue:** The site deploys, but has incorrect or missing content.

**Solutions:**

1. **Outdated Deployment**
   - Check the timestamp of the latest deployment in Actions
   - Verify your latest commits are reflected in the deployed site
   - Force a new deployment using the workflow_dispatch trigger

2. **Content Processing Issues**
   - If specific content is not rendering correctly:
     - Check front matter formatting for affected pages
     - Verify markdown syntax is correct
     - Look for Hugo shortcode errors

3. **Template Problems**
   - If layout issues occur:
     - Verify your theme is correctly loaded
     - Check partial templates for errors
     - Ensure any custom layouts are working correctly

## Workflow Takes Too Long

**Issue:** The deployment process is unusually slow.

**Solutions:**

1. **Large Repository**
   - If the checkout step takes too long:
     - Consider using a shallow clone with appropriate fetch-depth
     - Split very large repositories if possible

2. **Optimize Hugo Build**
   - If the build step is slow:
     - Consider using Hugo's --enableGitInfo flag to speed up builds
     - Optimize image sizes and other assets
     - Use Hugo's caching mechanisms

3. **Too Many Files**
   - If the artifact upload is slow:
     - Check for unnecessary files being included
     - Consider adding patterns to .gitignore for generated files
     - Use the workflow to clean up unnecessary files before upload

## Debugging Techniques

When troubleshooting, these techniques can help identify the source of problems:

1. **Add Debug Steps**
   - Insert additional steps to list directories or file contents:
     ```yaml
     - name: Debug - List files
       run: ls -la public/
     ```

2. **Use GitHub Actions Debug Logging**
   - Enable debugging by setting secrets:
     ```
     ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
     ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
     ```

3. **Local vs. Actions Environment**
   - Test the exact same Hugo command locally that's used in the workflow
   - Compare outputs to identify environment-specific issues

4. **Inspect Deployed Files**
   - Check out the gh-pages branch or deployed artifact to inspect the actual files
   - Compare with your local build output

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Likely Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Error: fatal: No url found for submodule path '...'` | Git submodule misconfiguration | Update .gitmodules file with correct paths |
| `Error: template for shortcode "..." not found` | Missing theme or shortcode | Ensure theme is correctly installed |
| `Error: module "..." not found` | Hugo module issue | Check go.mod file and module imports |
| `Error: SASS processing failed` | SASS compilation error | Check SASS/SCSS files for syntax errors |
| `Error: API rate limit exceeded` | Too many GitHub API calls | Wait for rate limit to reset or authenticate API calls |
