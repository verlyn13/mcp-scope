# GitHub Actions Deployment Test

This file was created to test the GitHub Actions deployment workflow. If you're seeing this content on the deployed site, it means the GitHub Actions deployment is working correctly!

## Deployment Verification

- Created: March 23, 2025
- Purpose: Workflow verification
- Expected result: This file should appear on the deployed site shortly after being pushed to the main branch

## Key Workflow Features Tested

1. **Automatic triggering** on push to main branch
2. **Content processing** by Hugo
3. **Proper deployment** to GitHub Pages

If you can see this page with proper formatting and navigation, the GitHub Actions deployment workflow is functioning as expected.
