# GitHub Pages Deployment Solution

{{< status >}}

This document outlines the solution to the GitHub Pages deployment issues previously encountered with the MCP documentation site.

## The Issue

GitHub Pages deployment was failing with 404 errors due to a fundamental mismatch between:

1. **Hugo's build output** - Files are generated in the `public/` directory
2. **GitHub Pages requirements** - Files must be in the root of the branch (not in a subdirectory)

Additionally, there were issues with:
- Getting "stuck" in the gh-pages branch after deployment
- Inconsistent verification of critical files
- Authentication challenges when pushing to GitHub

## The Solution: Simplified Deployment Script

A new deployment script (`deploy-gh-pages.sh`) has been created that addresses these issues with a streamlined approach:

```bash
./deploy-gh-pages.sh
```

### Key Features

1. **Branch Awareness**
   - Tracks which branch you started on
   - Returns to that branch after deployment
   - Prevents getting "stuck" in gh-pages

2. **Proper File Placement**
   - Correctly copies files from `public/` to the root of the gh-pages branch
   - Adds a `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing
   - Verifies critical files are in the correct location

3. **Authentication Handling**
   - Uses a locally stored GitHub token when available
   - Falls back to standard GitHub authentication if no token is found
   - Clear feedback about authentication method being used

4. **Verification Steps**
   - Confirms Hugo build produced the expected files
   - Verifies files were copied correctly
   - Checks for index.html specifically

## How to Use the Deployment Script

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Token** (Optional but recommended)
   - For smoother authentication, create a GitHub Personal Access Token with:
     - Contents (read/write) permission
     - Pages (read/write) permission 
     - Metadata (read) permission
   - Store it in `/home/verlyn13/.secrets/mcp-scope/github_token`
   - The file should contain: `export GH_PAT="your_token_here"`

2. **Hugo Installation**
   - The script will attempt to use `./deploy-docs.sh --build-only` for building
   - If that's not available, it will try to use the `hugo` command directly

### Deployment Steps

1. Make your documentation changes in the main branch
2. Commit your changes
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-gh-pages.sh
   ```
4. The script will handle all necessary steps and return you to your original branch
5. The site will be available at `https://verlyn13.github.io/mcp-scope/` after GitHub Pages updates (typically a few minutes)

## GitHub Pages Configuration

Ensure your GitHub Pages settings are configured properly:

1. Go to: Repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages"
   - Folder: "/ (root)"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **404 Errors**: 
   - Check that index.html exists in the root of the gh-pages branch
   - Verify GitHub Pages settings are correct

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Ensure your GitHub token has the proper permissions
   - Check that the token is correctly stored and exported

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Run the script with more verbose output: `bash -x ./deploy-gh-pages.sh`
   - Look for specific error messages during the process

## Implementation Details

The `deploy-gh-pages.sh` script uses a six-step process:

1. **Build**: Run Hugo to generate the site in the public/ directory
2. **Branch**: Switch to (or create) the gh-pages branch
3. **Clean**: Remove existing content from the gh-pages branch
4. **Copy**: Move files from public/ to the branch root
5. **Commit**: Add and commit the changes, then push to GitHub
6. **Return**: Switch back to the original branch

This approach ensures a clean, reliable deployment process that works with GitHub Pages' requirements while maintaining a good developer experience.
