# GitHub Pages Deployment Solution

## Overview

We have implemented a bulletproof GitHub Actions deployment system for our Hugo documentation site. This modern approach resolves all previously encountered deployment issues by leveraging GitHub's native deployment capabilities.

## âœ… Implementation Complete

The GitHub Actions deployment system has been fully implemented and is now the **official deployment method** for this project. All team members should use this approach for documentation deployment.

## Key Benefits

- **No Branch Switching Required** - Work only on the main content branch
- **Fully Automated** - Deployments trigger automatically on pushes to main
- **Consistent Environment** - Same build process regardless of who deploys
- **Better Security** - Uses GitHub's built-in authentication

## Documentation Resources

This set of documents provides everything you need to understand, use, and troubleshoot our deployment system:

### Primary Resources

1. [**GitHub Actions Deployment Guide**](github-actions-deployment-guide.md)
   - Comprehensive explanation of how the system works
   - Technical details on workflow configuration
   - Benefits over previous deployment methods

2. [**Deployment Verification Checklist**](github-actions-deployment-checklist.md)
   - Step-by-step checklist to verify deployment is working
   - Testing procedures to confirm proper configuration
   - Post-deployment verification steps

3. [**Troubleshooting Guide**](github-actions-troubleshooting.md)
   - Solutions for common deployment issues
   - Debugging techniques for workflow problems
   - Error message reference and resolution steps

### How to Deploy

#### Automatic Deployment

The site automatically deploys whenever changes are pushed to the main branch:

```bash
# Make your changes to content
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation content"
git push
# That's it! The site will deploy automatically
```

#### Manual Deployment

If needed, you can manually trigger a deployment:

1. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select "Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select main branch and click "Run workflow"

## Previous Deployment Methods (Deprecated)

The following scripts are now **deprecated** and should not be used for deployment:

- `deploy-docs.sh`
- `deploy-gh-pages.sh`
- `deploy-to-github-pages.sh`

These scripts remain in the repository for reference purposes only.

## Implementation Notes

The deployment is managed by the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/hugo-deploy.yml`, which:

1. Installs Hugo with extended features
2. Checks out the repository with submodules
3. Builds the site with the correct base URL
4. Creates a `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing
5. Uploads and deploys the site using GitHub's deployment API

## Status and Support

If you encounter any issues with the deployment system:

1. First, consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](github-actions-troubleshooting.md)
2. Check the Actions tab for specific error messages
3. If problems persist, contact the documentation team lead
