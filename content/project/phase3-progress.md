# Phase 3 Migration Progress

{{< status >}}

## Overview

Phase 3 of the ScopeCam MCP documentation migration to Hugo is currently in progress. This phase focuses on supporting documentation, including guides, references, and process documents that complement the technical documentation migrated in Phase 2.

{{< callout "info" "Current Status" >}}
Phase 3 migration is approximately 40% complete, with 7 of 17 supporting documents migrated to Hugo format.

## Documents Completed

The following documents have been successfully migrated in Phase 3:

### Project Documentation

| Documentation Guidelines | ðŸŸ¢ Active | `/content/standards/documentation-guidelines.md` |
| Status System | ðŸŸ¢ Active | `/content/standards/status-system.md` |
| Shortcode Standards | ðŸŸ¢ Active | `/content/standards/shortcode-standards.md` |
| Contributing Guide | ðŸŸ¢ Active | `/content/project/contributing.md` |

| Current Focus | ðŸŸ  Draft | `/content/project/current-focus.md` |
| Build Engineer Next Steps | ðŸŸ  Draft | `/content/project/build-engineer-next-steps.md` |
| Migration Completion Plan | ðŸŸ  Draft | `/content/project/migration-completion.md` |

## Documents Remaining

The following documents are awaiting migration:

1. **Health Monitoring Guide**
2. **Deployment Reliability**
3. **Documentation Compliance Check**
4. **Documentation Maintenance Guide**
5. **Migration Roles and Responsibilities**
6. **Template Integration Plan**
7. **Project Organization**

## Applied Enhancements

In Phase 3, we've applied several enhancements to the migrated documents:

### 1. Improved Metadata

- Added more detailed front matter
- Enhanced tagging for better categorization
- Added comprehensive related documents sections

### 2. Enhanced Visual Elements

- Applied status indicators consistently
- Implemented progress tracking where appropriate
- Added code syntax highlighting with language specifications

### 3. Standardized Shortcodes

The following shortcodes have been implemented consistently:

- <code>{{&lt; status &gt;}}</code> - Displays document status badges
- <code>{{&lt; toc &gt;}}</code> - Generates table of contents for longer documents
- <code>{{&lt; related-docs &gt;}}</code> - Lists related documentation automatically
- <code>{{&lt; callout &gt;}}</code> - Creates styled information boxes

## Migration Challenges

During Phase 3, we've encountered and addressed the following challenges:

1. **Cross-Reference Complexity**
   - Supporting documents contain many cross-references
   - Needed to update all links to Hugo format
   - Implemented related-docs shortcode for consistency

2. **Status Tracking**
   - Many documents are in different stages of development
   - Implemented consistent status indicators
   - Created tracking system for migration progress

3. **Formatting Consistency**
   - Supporting documents use more varied formatting
   - Standardized headings, lists, and tables
   - Applied consistent styling across all documents

## Next Steps

To complete Phase 3, the following steps are planned:

1. **Complete Remaining Migrations**
   - Prioritize documents that support active development
   - Update all internal links to reflect new structure
   - Apply consistent styling and formatting

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify all shortcodes work correctly
   - Ensure all links resolve properly
   - Validate metadata completeness

3. **Phase 4 Preparation**
   - Plan for template and reference document migration
   - Create templates for specialized document types
   - Develop plan for recurring document updates
