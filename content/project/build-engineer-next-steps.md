# Build Engineer Next Steps

{{< status >}}

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Project Documentation](/project/) | [‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/)

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps for the build engineer to continue MCP implementation work. It consolidates information from existing plans and provides a clear sequence of tasks based on the current project state.

{{< callout "info" "Task Prioritization" >}}
Tasks are prioritized based on project needs and dependencies. Critical tasks should be completed first, followed by high and medium priority items.

## Current Project Status

The initial implementation of the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) is well underway. The following components have been completed:

- ‚úÖ Project structure and organization
- ‚úÖ Core MCP framework (interfaces, models, state machine)
- ‚úÖ NATS messaging integration
- ‚úÖ Basic orchestrator with agent management
- ‚úÖ Camera integration agent with mock USB detection
- ‚úÖ Python processor agent
- ‚úÖ Containerized development environment
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Unit testing framework
- ‚úÖ Health monitoring system with metrics collection
- ‚úÖ Resilience mechanisms (circuit breaker, state change listeners)

## Next Day Tasks

### 1. Gradle and Build System Setup (Priority: Critical)

{{< callout "warning" "Critical Task" >}}
The Gradle setup is critical for ensuring consistent build environments across the team. Complete this task before moving on to other implementation work.
{{< /callout >}}

1. **Set up Gradle 8.12 environment**
   - Install Gradle 8.12 for local development
   - Configure Gradle wrapper in the project
   - Update Docker containers to use Gradle 8.12

2. **Validate tests in both environments**
   - Run tests in local environment
   - Run tests in containerized environment
   - Fix any environment-specific issues

### 2. Integration Testing (Priority: High)

1. **Implement integration tests**
   - Create tests for agent-to-orchestrator communication
   - Test task distribution and execution flow
   - Verify correct handling of error scenarios

### 3. Health Monitoring Dashboard (Priority: Medium)

1. **Create health visualization frontend**
   - Implement simple web dashboard for health metrics
   - Add real-time agent status visualization
   - Create system resource utilization graphs

### 4. Advanced Agent Features (Priority: Medium)

1. **Enhance Camera Integration Agent**
   - Add support for multiple camera devices
   - Implement frame capture simulation
   - Create connection state management

2. **Expand Python Processor Agent**
   - Add more data processing capabilities
   - Implement image processing simulation
   - Create task queue for handling multiple requests

### 5. Android Integration (Priority: Medium)

1. **Create Android client library**
   - Implement NATS client for Android
   - Add message serialization/deserialization
   - Create API for camera operations

2. **Set up communication patterns**
   - Implement request-reply for commands
   - Add pub-sub for status updates
   - Create event handling for camera events

## Implementation Progress

| Component | Status | Completion |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Gradle Setup | üü† In Progress | {{< progress value="20" >}} |
| Integration Testing | üü° Draft | {{< progress value="30" >}} |
| Health Dashboard | üü° Draft | {{< progress value="15" >}} |
| Advanced Agent Features | üü° Draft | {{< progress value="25" >}} |
| Android Integration | üî¥ Planned | {{< progress value="5" >}} |

## Getting Started (Tomorrow Morning)

{{< callout "tip" "Morning Routine" >}}
Starting with these steps first thing in the morning will set up your development environment for the rest of the day's tasks.
{{< /callout >}}

1. **Install Gradle 8.12**
   ```bash
   # Download and install Gradle 8.12
   wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.12-bin.zip
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/gradle
   sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-8.12-bin.zip
   sudo ln -s /opt/gradle/gradle-8.12/bin/gradle /usr/local/bin/gradle
   
   # Generate Gradle wrapper in the project
   cd mcp-project
   gradle wrapper
   ```

2. **Update Dockerfiles for Gradle 8.12**
   ```bash
   # Edit Dockerfile.dev for mcp-core and camera-agent
   # Replace the current Gradle version with 8.12
   vim mcp-core/Dockerfile.dev
   vim agents/camera-agent/Dockerfile.dev
   ```

3. **Test the system with new Gradle version**
   ```bash
   # Run tests in local environment
   cd mcp-project
   ./gradlew test
   
   # Rebuild and test in containerized environment
   podman-compose down
   podman-compose build
   podman-compose up -d
   ```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Follow existing patterns**
   - Maintain the state machine pattern for agent lifecycle
   - Use coroutines for asynchronous operations
   - Keep consistent error handling approaches

2. **Testing best practices**
   - Write tests before or alongside implementation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test both success and failure scenarios

3. **Documentation updates**
   - Update relevant documentation when adding new features
   - Follow the [Path Reference Guide](/project/path-reference-guide/)
   - Maintain status indicators and versioning

## Completed Task Summary

The following high-priority tasks have been completed:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - ‚úÖ Unit tests for AgentStateMachine
   - ‚úÖ Tests for NatsConnectionManager
   - ‚úÖ Tests for Orchestrator

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - ‚úÖ SystemMetricsCollector for JVM metrics
   - ‚úÖ HealthCheckService with NATS endpoints
   - ‚úÖ Circuit breaker pattern implementation
   - ‚úÖ State change listeners for agent state tracking

3. **Resilience Mechanisms**
   - ‚úÖ Circuit breaker for failure handling
   - ‚úÖ Error recovery mechanisms
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling in state transitions

## Reference Implementation Files

These files provide good examples to follow for implementing new features:

- `mcp-core/src/main/kotlin/com/example/mcp/AgentStateMachine.kt`
- `mcp-core/src/main/kotlin/com/example/mcp/NatsConnectionManager.kt`
- `mcp-core/src/main/kotlin/com/example/mcp/Orchestrator.kt`

- `mcp-core/src/main/kotlin/com/example/mcp/health/HealthCheckService.kt`

## Task Tracking

To keep track of your progress, use comments to mark completed tasks:

```kotlin
// DONE: Implement health check endpoint
// TODO: Add support for multiple camera devices
// IN PROGRESS: Configure Gradle 8.12 in containers
```

## Alignment with Strategic Plan

These tasks align with Phase 2 of the strategic plan as outlined in the current plan, focusing on:

- Health monitoring and resilience
- Specialized agent capabilities
- Integration with Android applications
