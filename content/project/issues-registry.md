# Issues Registry

{{< status >}}

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Project Documentation](/project/) | [‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/)

## Overview

The Issues Registry is a central catalog of known issues, limitations, pitfalls, and technical challenges in the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP). This document helps developers avoid common problems and provides solutions or workarounds where available.

{{< callout "info" "Purpose" >}}
This registry serves as both a reference for current developers and a knowledge base for future team members, capturing institutional knowledge about system limitations and workarounds.
{{< /callout >}}

## Health Monitoring Issues

### MCP-HEALTH-001: False Positive Detection

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Health Monitoring Framework  
**Description**: Transient issues can trigger false positive health alerts, especially under high system load.

**Impact**:
- Unnecessary agent restarts
- Alert fatigue for operators
- Wasted system resources

**Mitigation**:
- Implement adaptive thresholds based on system load
- Require multiple consecutive failures before alerting
- Use trend analysis instead of point-in-time checks
- See [Health Monitoring Framework](/architecture/health-monitoring-framework/) for details

### MCP-HEALTH-002: Resource Overhead

**Status**: üü° **Mitigated**  
**Component**: Health Monitoring Framework  
**Description**: Health monitoring itself consumes system resources, which can impact performance if not carefully managed.

**Impact**:
- Additional CPU/memory usage for monitoring
- Network bandwidth for health check messages
- Potential performance impact under heavy load

**Mitigation**:
- Adaptive monitoring frequency based on system state
- Efficient metric collection methods
- Configurable monitoring detail level
- See [Health Monitoring Framework](/architecture/health-monitoring-framework/) for optimization details

## Development Environment Issues

## Adding New Issues

{{< callout "tip" "Issue Creation" >}}
When adding new issues, use the format and structure of existing entries to maintain consistency. All issues should have a unique identifier, clear description, impact assessment, and mitigation strategy when available.
{{< /callout >}}

When adding new issues to this registry:

1. Create a unique identifier with component prefix
2. Clearly describe the issue and its impact
3. Document any known workarounds or mitigations
4. Cross-reference relevant technical documentation
5. Assign appropriate status
6. Update the "last_updated" field in the front matter

## Issue Resolution Process

1. Issues are initially documented with Open status
2. Workarounds are added as they become available
3. Status is updated to In Progress when actively being addressed
4. Mitigated status is used when partial solutions exist
5. Resolved issues remain in the registry with solution documentation
6. Critical issues should trigger notification to the development team

## Periodic Review

This registry undergoes regular review to:

1. Update issue statuses
2. Add newly discovered issues
3. Verify resolution effectiveness
4. Archive obsolete issues
5. Identify patterns requiring architectural changes

## Cross-Referencing

When referencing issues from technical documentation, use the following format:

```markdown
This functionality has a [known issue with permission handling](/project/issues-registry/#mcp-cam-001-usb-device-permission-handling).
```

Similarly, issue descriptions should link to relevant technical documentation for more details.
