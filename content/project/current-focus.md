# Current Project Focus: Phase 1 Core Infrastructure

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Start Here](/docs/START_HERE.md) | [‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/README.md)

> **Last Updated**: March 22, 2025  
> **Next Update**: March 29, 2025

## Current Sprint Priority

We are currently in **Sprint 1** of Phase 1 implementation, focused on establishing the core infrastructure components of the Multi-Agent Control Platform.

### Primary Objectives This Week

1. **Implement FSM Framework and Agent Interfaces** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - Complete the core agent state machine implementation
   - Implement the base agent interface
   - Create the agent lifecycle management components

2. **Set Up NATS Messaging Integration**
   - Establish connection management
   - Implement message serialization/deserialization
   - Create topic structure and routing

3. **Begin Orchestrator Implementation**
   - Develop agent registry
   - Start task scheduler implementation
   - Set up basic event handling

## Progress Tracking

### Completed This Week

- Architecture specifications finalized
- Documentation system established
- Development environment setup documented

### Upcoming Next Week

- FSM framework implementation
- NATS integration configuration
- Basic orchestrator skeleton

## Technical Focus Areas

### State Machine Implementation

The primary technical focus is implementing the FSM using Tinder's StateMachine library:

```kotlin
sealed class AgentState {
    object Idle : AgentState()
    object Initializing : AgentState()
    object Processing : AgentState()
    data class Error(val message: String, val exception: Exception? = null) : AgentState()
    object ShuttingDown : AgentState()
}

class AgentStateMachine(private val agent: McpAgent) {
    private val stateMachine = StateMachine.create<AgentState, AgentEvent, Unit> {
        initialState(AgentState.Idle)
        
        // State transitions to be implemented
        // See architecture specification for details
    }
}
```

Refer to the [FSM and Agent Interfaces Specification](/docs/architecture/fsm-agent-interfaces.md) for complete details.

### Agent Interface Implementation

The second focus is implementing the core agent interface:

```kotlin
interface McpAgent {
    val agentId: String
    val agentType: String
    val capabilities: Set<Capability>
    
    suspend fun initialize(): Boolean
    suspend fun processTask(task: AgentTask): TaskResult
    fun getStatus(): AgentStatus
    suspend fun shutdown()
    suspend fun handleError(error: Exception): Boolean
}
```

### NATS Messaging Setup

The third focus is setting up the NATS messaging infrastructure:

```kotlin
class NatsConnectionManager(private val config: NatsConfig) {
    // Configuration and connection management
    // See architecture specification for details
}
```

## Weekly Meeting Schedule

| Meeting | Day | Time | Focus |
|---------|-----|------|-------|
| Sprint Planning | Monday | 10:00 AM | Set priorities for the week |
| Technical Sync | Wednesday | 2:00 PM | Resolve technical questions |
| Sprint Review | Friday | 3:00 PM | Review progress and blockers |

## Notes from Project Lead

> "This week's focus on the FSM framework is critical as it establishes the foundation for all agent interactions. We need to ensure the state machine is robust enough to handle complex state transitions while remaining simple to use. Pay special attention to error handling and recovery mechanisms."

## Documentation Priorities

The following documentation needs to be completed to support the current focus:

1. Complete [Core Framework Implementation Guide](/docs/implementation/core-framework.md)
2. Update [Project Setup Guide](/docs/implementation/project-setup.md) with latest environment requirements
3. Create unit testing examples for the FSM framework

## Next Update

This document will be updated on **March 29, 2025** with the next sprint's focus areas and progress report.
