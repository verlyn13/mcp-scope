# Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) Project Clarification

## Overview

This document clarifies the nature and scope of the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) project to ensure proper understanding and documentation across all project materials.

## Project Identity

The **Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP)** is a general-purpose server framework designed to:

1. Orchestrate multiple specialized software agents
2. Facilitate communication between these agents using a standardized messaging system
3. Provide a unified architecture for agent lifecycle management
4. Monitor and report on system health and status
5. Enable integration with various client applications

## Important Distinction

**MCP is not specifically tied to the ScopeCam project.** While ScopeCam (an Android application for microscope control) may utilize MCP as its server component, the MCP itself is designed to be a versatile platform that can be used by many different client applications.

## Documentation Guidelines

To maintain clarity throughout all project documentation:

1. **Always refer to the project as:**
   - "Multi-Agent Control Platform" (full name)
   - "MCP" (acronym)
   - "MCP server" (when emphasizing the server component)

2. **When discussing client integrations:**
   - Clearly separate MCP functionality from client-specific functionality
   - Use phrasing like "MCP can be used by client applications such as ScopeCam"
   - Avoid phrases that imply MCP belongs to or is exclusively for ScopeCam

3. **For ScopeCam-specific extensions:**
   - Clearly label these as extensions or integrations
   - Document them in dedicated sections for client integrations

## Repository Structure

The repository structure reflects this distinction:

- `/mcp-project/` - Contains the core MCP implementation
- `/content/mcp/` - Contains MCP-specific documentation
- `/content/` - Contains higher-level documentation that may reference both MCP and potential client applications

## Audience Considerations

When creating documentation, consider that readers may be:

1. **MCP Developers** - Focused on the core platform
2. **Client Application Developers** - Interested in how to integrate with MCP
3. **Specialized Agent Developers** - Building agents to run on the MCP

Documentation should be organized to serve these different audiences while maintaining the distinction between the MCP platform itself and any specific client applications that may use it.
