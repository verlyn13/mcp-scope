# ScopeCam MCP Documentation: Hugo Migration Index

üü¢ **Active**

[‚Ü©Ô∏è Back to Documentation Index](/docs/README.md)

## Overview

This document provides an index of all resources related to the migration of ScopeCam MCP documentation to a Hugo-based static site for GitHub Pages deployment. The migration has been carefully designed to preserve the existing documentation structure, align with project standards, and integrate with the containerized development environment.

## Migration Documentation

The migration plan consists of the following documents, each addressing a specific aspect of the migration process:

### Core Planning Documents

| [GitHub Workflow](github-workflow-setup.md) | GitHub Actions for automated deployment | üü¢ Active |

## Implementation Flow

The migration follows this implementation flow:

1. **Foundation Setup** (Week 1)
   - Create containerized environment
   - Configure Hugo project structure
   - Set up theme foundation

2. **Content Migration** (Week 2)
   - Convert existing documentation
   - Update internal references
   - Validate content integrity

3. **Theme Development** (Week 2-3)
   - Implement status system
   - Create dual-layer navigation
   - Develop custom shortcodes

4. **Environment Integration** (Week 3)
   - Integrate with containerized development
   - Add health monitoring
   - Set up automated validation

5. **Deployment** (Week 4)
   - Configure GitHub Pages
   - Implement automated deployment
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

6. **Post-Migration Activities** (Week 4+)
   - Create contributor documentation
   - Train team members
   - Establish maintenance workflow

## Key Integration Points

The Hugo documentation system integrates with existing project components:

### Containerization

The documentation system is fully containerized using:
- Custom Dockerfile.hugo
- Integration with podman-compose.yml
- Consistent with existing container patterns

### Existing Tools

Integration with current documentation tools:
- Extended doc-manager.py for Hugo support
- Reused validation mechanisms
- Existing Python utilities

### Health Monitoring

Documentation health integrated into the monitoring framework:
- Build status monitoring
- Freshness metrics
- Link validation

### Automated CI/CD

Documentation validation in automated pipelines:
- Pre-commit validation
- Pull request checks
- Automated deployment

## Getting Started

To begin working with the Hugo documentation system:

1. **First Steps**: Review the [Migration Executive Summary](hugo-migration-executive-summary.md)
2. **Container Setup**: Follow the [Containerized Setup](hugo-containerized-setup.md) guide
3. **Development Process**: Use the [Implementation Steps](hugo-implementation-steps-update.md) for detailed instructions

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Documentation Contributors

When creating or updating documentation:

1. Use the containerized environment for local preview
2. Follow the document standards in [Documentation Guidelines](/docs/standards/documentation-guidelines.md)
3. Run validation before committing changes
4. Ensure front matter includes all required fields
5. Update related documents as needed

### System Administrators

For system-level management:

1. Monitor documentation health in the dashboard
2. Check build logs for deployment issues
3. Manage GitHub Pages configuration
4. Update containers as needed
