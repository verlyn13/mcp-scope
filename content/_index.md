# Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP)

A distributed, message-driven orchestration platform that coordinates specialized agents for complex system integrations.

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) provides a robust framework for creating, managing, and coordinating autonomous agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks. Built around a central orchestrator with a message-driven architecture, MCP enables seamless integration of components written in different languages and running on different systems.

### Key Features

- **Distributed Architecture**: Agents can run on different machines while coordinating activities
- **Language Agnostic**: Support for agents written in Kotlin, Java, Python, and potentially other languages
- **Message-Driven**: Uses NATS as a high-performance messaging backbone
- **State Machine Based**: Clear, well-defined agent lifecycles
- **Extensible**: Easy to create new specialized agents for specific tasks
- **Containerized**: Optional fully containerized development and deployment

## Core Components

- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination engine that manages agents and distributes tasks
- **Agent Framework**: Common interfaces and base classes for creating agents
- **NATS Integration**: Message transport for agent communication
- **Camera Integration Agent**: Example agent for interfacing with USB cameras
- **Python Processor Agent**: Example agent demonstrating Python integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Python 3.11 or later
- NATS Server
- Podman/Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/mcp-project.git
   cd mcp-project
   ```

2. **Choose your development approach**:
   - [Local Development](/docs/implementation/local-development-guide.md) (recommended for daily work)
   - [Containerized Development](/docs/implementation/containerized-development-guide.md) (for consistent environments)

3. **Follow the getting started guide**:
   - Detailed instructions in [First Steps Guide](/docs/project/first-steps.md)

## Development Environment Options

MCP supports two primary development workflows:

### Local Development

Develop and run components directly on your machine for faster iteration cycles and easier debugging. This approach is recommended for daily development work.

```bash
# Example: Run the core orchestrator locally
cd mcp-core
./gradlew run
```

See the [Local Development Guide](/docs/implementation/local-development-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

### Containerized Development

Use containers for a consistent development environment that closely resembles production. This approach is ideal for ensuring compatibility across different machines.

```bash
# Start the entire system in containers
podman-compose up -d
```

See the [Containerized Development Guide](/docs/implementation/containerized-development-guide.md) for details.
