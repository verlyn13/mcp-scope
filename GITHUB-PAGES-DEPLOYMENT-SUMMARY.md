# GitHub Pages Deployment Summary

## Implementation Status

âœ… **IMPLEMENTED:** The MCP documentation project has successfully adopted GitHub Actions for automated Hugo site deployment to GitHub Pages, resolving all previous deployment issues.

## New Deployment Process

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/hugo-deploy.yml`) now handles all deployment tasks:

1. Automatically triggers on pushes to the main branch
2. Builds the Hugo site with proper configuration
3. Deploys directly to GitHub Pages using GitHub's deployment API
4. Provides deployment status and links through the Actions tab

**Documentation:** For complete details on the new deployment system, see [GitHub Actions Deployment Guide](/content/project/github-actions-deployment-guide.md)

## Previous Issues (Now Resolved)

The project previously faced these deployment challenges:

1. **404 Errors in GitHub Pages** - Files were not correctly placed in the gh-pages branch root
2. **Branch Switching Problems** - Developers got "stuck" in gh-pages branch after deployment
3. **Path Resolution Issues** - Scripts couldn't reliably locate directories after branch switching

### Legacy Scripts (No Longer Needed for Deployment)

These scripts remain in the repository for reference but are no longer required for deployment:
- `deploy-docs.sh` - Original script that builds the Hugo site
- `deploy-gh-pages.sh` - Script that attempted manual deployment
- `deploy-to-github-pages.sh` - Script that used a local GitHub token

## GitHub Pages Configuration

The GitHub Pages settings are now configured to:
- Deploy from GitHub Actions
- Use the HTTPS protocol

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **No Branch Switching Required**
   - Developers only work on the main content branch
   - Eliminates "stuck in gh-pages branch" issues

2. **Consistent Deployment Environment**
   - Same Hugo version used every time
   - No local environment differences affecting deployment

3. **Fully Automated**
   - Happens automatically on every push to main branch
   - Can also be triggered manually from GitHub Actions tab

4. **Better Security**
   - No personal access tokens required
   - Authentication uses GitHub's built-in token system
