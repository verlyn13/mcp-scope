Overview This guide details the recommended containerized development environment for the Multi-Agent Control Platform (MCP) using Podman and Podman Compose. This setup provides environment consistency, isolation, and resource efficiency while maintaining development speed.
Why Podman? Podman is particularly well-suited for the MCP development on Fedora Linux for several key reasons:
Lower Resource Overhead: Podman is a daemonless container engine that consumes fewer resources than Docker&amp;rsquo;s daemon-based approach Native to Fedora: Podman comes pre-installed or easily available on Fedora, making it a natural fit Docker Compose Compatibility: Podman supports Docker Compose files through podman-compose Rootless Containers: Podman allows running containers without root privileges, improving security Systemd Integration: Better integration with Linux systemd for service management Prerequisites Before setting up the containerized environment, ensure you have the following installed:</description></item><item><title>MCP Containerized Development Guide</title><link>https://example.github.io/mcp-scope/mcp/mcp/containerized-development-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.github.io/mcp-scope/mcp/mcp/containerized-development-guide/</guid><description>MCP Containerized Development Guide 🟢 Active
