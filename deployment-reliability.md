# MCP Documentation System: Deployment Reliability Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to enhance deployment reliability for the MCP Documentation System, focusing on container image handling and error recovery.

## Container Registry Enhancements

### 1. Multiple Registry Support

The system now tries multiple registries when pulling the Hugo image:

```bash
# Registry fallback sequence
docker.io/klakegg/hugo:0.110-ext-alpine
klakegg/hugo:0.110-ext-alpine
docker.io/klakegg/hugo:latest-ext-alpine
```

If one registry fails, the system automatically tries the next without user intervention.

### 2. Version Flexibility

We've updated the image reference to use a more flexible version specification:

- Before: `klakegg/hugo:0.110.0-ext-alpine` (specific patch version)
- After: `docker.io/klakegg/hugo:0.110-ext-alpine` (major.minor version)

This improves availability across registries while maintaining compatibility.

## Local Image Caching

### 1. Pre-Cache Script

A new `precache-images.sh` script has been created for environment setup:

```bash
./precache-images.sh
```

This script:
- Pulls images from multiple registries
- Falls back to local builds if necessary
- Tags images for use with the documentation system
- Provides clear status feedback

Running this during environment setup prevents runtime failures during deployment.

### 2. Automatic Local Building

If pulling from all registries fails, the system will automatically attempt to build the image locally using the provided Dockerfile.

## Robust Error Handling

### 1. Clear Error Messages

Error messages now include:
- Specific error identification
- Likely causes of the error
- Suggested recovery steps

### 2. Manual Recovery Guidance

When deployment fails, the system provides explicit instructions for manual recovery:

```
Manual recovery steps:
1. Install Hugo directly: https://gohugo.io/installation/
2. Run: hugo --minify
3. The generated site will be in the 'public' directory
4. You can then manually copy this to the gh-pages branch
```

## Implementation Details

These improvements have been implemented in:

1. `mcp-docs.sh` - Enhanced container handling and error recovery
2. `Dockerfile.hugo` - Updated image reference
3. `precache-images.sh` - New script for image caching
4. `DOCUMENTATION-README.md` - Updated documentation
5. `git-workflow.md` - Added deployment troubleshooting

## Usage Recommendations

1. Run `./precache-images.sh` during initial environment setup
2. Use `./mcp-docs deploy` for standard deployments
3. If issues occur, follow the recovery steps provided in the error messages

These changes significantly improve deployment reliability while maintaining the efficient containerized workflow.
